| Bug | File | Commit |
|-----|------|--------|
| PRDSim cursor invisible | S04_Maya.tsx | `a436601` |
| zenVerdict refs "Nova" not in portal | simulations.ts | `ae4c4d9` |
| Missing Twitter card metadata | layout.tsx | `786eb7f` |
| CTA placeholder color unset | S13_CTA.tsx | `dcce4c3` |
| `rand(0.9,0.9)` no-op — all loop arcs same | PortalScene.tsx | `8ef444a` |

---

## Repo Hygiene (2026-06-15)

- `portal-v3` — deleted local + remote (confirmed fast-forward merged to main, Day 155)
- `act-ii-portal` — pushed to `origin/act-ii-portal` (local backup preserved; 2 commits ahead of dark-manifesto; unmerged, decision pending)
- `web/.next/` — verified already gitignored (line 13) and never tracked; no action needed
- `worktree-dark-manifesto`'s only unmerged content (WaterCursor.tsx) is now superseded by main's Lighthouse-99-optimized version — flagged for deletion next hygiene pass, not deleted this session.

## Known Issues (next session)

*(none — all Day 155 items resolved)*

## Current State

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Live URL | forgeos-eight.vercel.app |
| main branch | `e9d891d` |
| Test suite | 167/167 passing |
| MRR | ₹0 |

---

## Next Session Starts With

1. LaunchAgent SPEC.md — Day 2 of current sprint: author spec doc for new LaunchAgent (not a migration)

---

## Key Invariants to Preserve

1. `ForgeAgent.run()` is the single point of GBrainLogger lifecycle (`start` → `finish`) — never call `logger.start/finish` from `_execute`
2. `agents/__init__.py` must keep `BaseAgent` as the only eager import — all subclasses in `_LAZY`
3. `gbrain-events.jsonl` is append-only during a build — never truncate or rewrite
4. `budget_usd = 0.0` means unlimited — use it for agents that run mid/late pipeline (no useful cap)
5. All ForgeOS `from` imports are absolute (`from models import X`, not `from .models import X`)
6. PMAgent and EvalAgent are NOT in `agents/__init__._LAZY` — they're imported directly in `hermes.py`
